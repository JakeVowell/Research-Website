<div class="The First Computer">
<h2> The First Computer</h2>
  <p> Around 1942, the U.S. Army was in need of the ability to calculate complex wartime ballistics. In reaction to this, physicist John Mauchly proposed his fully electronic calculating machine called the ENIAC. This was the first computer to run at electronic speed without being sluggish due to having mechanical parts. It was hit by a lightning strike in 1955 but in that decade it had done more calculations than all of mankind up until that point. Despite working so well, it was extremely likely to fail. It had 18,000 vacuum tubes working at the same time. Engineers had to make very strict circuit design guidelines to maximize productivity. They ran many tests to figure out how not to push the vacuum tubes to their limits. The main way they handled this was by not running the tubes at their max voltage to avoid pushing them to their limits to prolong life.

<div class="The Macintosh">
<h2> The Macintosh</h2>
<p> In 1984 Apple released the Macintosh. This was the first official version of the Mac. It had 128k RAM of memory, which later became clear that it was not enough. http://oldcomputers.net/macintosh.html. says that this was insufficient for the people. Eight months later Apple released an updated version with 512k Ram. This was referred to as the Fat Mac. Before the Macintosh, all computers were operated by text, meaning they were operated by typing words using the keyboard. The Macintosh was ran by clicking icons on the screen using the newly invented mouse. Almost all modern computers are now operated this way using a mouse. The Macintosh is considered the first success at using a GUI, or Graphical User Interface. </p>

<div class="Windows">
  <h2>Windows</h2>
  <p>In 1985 Microsoft released the first version of Windows, or Windows 1.0. It was direct follow up to MS-DOS. Today we currently have Windows 10 and it still retains many of the same features of Windows 1.0 such as scroll bars, drop down menus, icons, dialog boxes, and apps such as Notepad and MS paint. Windows 1.0 also was the first Microsoft program to use the mouse. You maneuvered by moving the mouse around and clicking compared to MS-DOS where you could only type in commands. It was very similar to the Macintosh in the aspect of being the first of its brand to use a mouse. It received much backlash because people said it was too heavily reliant on the mouse. It was also fairly hard to run. It required two floppy discs, 256 kilobytes of memory, and a graphics card. Aside from all the downsides it was very revolutionary to the future development of computers. According to https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/19/9759874/microsoft-windows-visual-history-30-years</p>

<div class="World Wide Web">
  <h2> The World Wide Web</h2>
  <p>In March of 1989 Tim Berners Lee, a software consultant at the European Organizations for Nuclear Research (or CERN), proposed his idea for an open computer network to keep track of research at their particle physics laboratory in Switzerland. He called it “Information Management: A proposal” which would later become the blueprint of the World Wide Web. It initially was not accepted as a great idea and it took nearly two years for him to set up the first successful communication between a web browser and the internet. The three main components of the World Wide Web are HTTP, URLs, and HTML, which Lee all invented. HTTP allowed you to click a link and be brought to a specific page. URLs served as an address for finding that specific document or page. HTML allows you to put links in documents and pages so they connect. A combination of these three led to the development of the World Wide Web. According to https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/day-the-web-was-born/ </p>

<div class="The First Cell Phone">
  <h2>The First Cell Phone</h2>
    <p>The world’s first cell phone was introduced in 1983. It was called Motorola DynaTAC 800x. It costed 4,000$ and only had enough battery for 30 minutes of talk time. It was about 12 inches long. The main purpose of cell phones at the time was to be able to talk in the car. Despite all the disadvantages, it was the first time in history people call someone else without the constraints of wires or phone holders. Radio based cell phones were a huge step to the development of cell phones. In the Second World War, military forces used radio telephone links. In 1940, hand held radio receivers were widely available, making it easier to communicate to battlefields around the world. The use of these radio receivers inspired Bell Labs and AT&T to come up with the Mobile Telephone Service. This led to cell phones and eventually the widespread use of them.
